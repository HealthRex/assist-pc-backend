Case 21

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
A 72-year-old married white female is referred for possible hyperthyroidism by her orthopedic surgeon.  Two weeks earlier, when seen by the orthopedist for back pain (thought due to osteoarthritis and compression vertebral fractures associated with osteoporosis), she was found to have a serum thyroxine level of 13.5 μg/dL.  There has been a 13.6 kg weight loss over the past two years.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
She has had a history of palpitations for several years and has been depressed off and on for at least 10-years.  Past medical history reveals a hysterectomy,  partial colectomy, appendectomy and partial gastrectomy.

FAMILY HISTORY
There is no family history of thyroid disease.

MEDICATIONS
Medications at present include 20 mg piroxicam daily, 7.5 mg hydrocodone bitartrate with 500 mg acetaminophen tablets every 4 hours for pain, 500 mg calcium with 125 IU vitamin D three times daily, 1.25 mg conjugated estrogen three times each week and 7.5 mg clorazepate dipotassium three times daily as needed for nervousness.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
Physical examination shows an elderly white female who appears depressed.  Pulse is 84/min and regular; blood pressure is 120/80 mmHg.  Eyes are unremarkable.  No goiter is present.  Moderate kyphosis, multiple abdominal scars and a bruised, swollen right knee are present.  The remainder of the physical examination is normal.

LABORATORY AND OTHER PROCEDURES
Laboratory studies previously obtained by her orthopedist 2-weeks earlier included the following:  hematocrit-37%; WBC-9600/mm3 with a normal differential.  Serum chemistry profile showed as follows: albumin-3.6 g/dL, calcium-9.5 mg/dL, phosphorous-2.9 mg/dL, glucose-121 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase-144 IU/L, SGOT-11 U/L, total protein-6.7 g/dL, cholesterol-170 mg/dL, BUN-11 mg/dL, creatinine-0.9 mg/dL, sodium-142 mEq/L, potassium-4.3 mEq/L, chloride-   104 mEq/L, and CO2-27 mEq/L.  Serum thyroxine was 13.5 μg/dL.
