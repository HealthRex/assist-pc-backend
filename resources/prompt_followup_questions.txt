Given a specialist-level clinical question and the corresponding LLM-generated specialist response,
generate a list of 3 high-quality follow-up questions that a primary care physician (or referring provider)
should consider asking the specialist.
These follow-up questions should be a list of high-yield follow-up questions
that a generalist clinician could ask the specialist in a referral or e-consult.
These follow-up questions should:
- clarify key uncertainties or next steps in the diagnostic or management plan
- anticipate potential patient-specific concerns or complications
- surface clinical thresholds: What triggers (e.g., lab values, red flags, time course) would change the specialistâ€™s diagnosis or management
You are writing these for a busy generalist clinician who may not have specialty expertise.
The goal is to empower thoughtful, proactive collaboration with a specialist and ensure critical issues are not missed.
Guidelines:
- questions should be concise one-liners and clinically specific
- avoid long, verbose questions or generic advice
- do not repeat information already clearly addressed in the original specialist response
Format:
Output exactly 3 follow-up questions.
No additional commentary or explanation is needed.
